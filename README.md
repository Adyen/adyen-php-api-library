  * [Account - Merchant level](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/ManagementService/v1/get/merchants): Returns the list of merchant accounts that your API credential has access to. The list is grouped into pages as defined by the query parameters. 
  * [API key - Merchant level](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/ManagementService/v1/post/merchants/{merchantId}/apiCredentials/{apiCredentialId}/generateApiKey): Returns a new API key for the API credential. You can use the new API key a few minutes after generating it. The old API key stops working 24 hours after generating a new one.

  * [Webhooks - Merchant level](https://docs.adyen.com/api-explorer/#/ManagementService/v1/post/merchants/{merchantId}/webhooks/{webhookId}/generateHmac) Returns an HMAC key for the webhook identified in the path. This key allows you to check the integrity and the origin of the notifications you receive.By creating an HMAC key, you start receiving HMAC-signed notifications from Adyen.

## Prerequisites

- [Adyen test account](https://docs.adyen.com/get-started-with-adyen)
- [API key](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#generate-api-key). For testing, your API credential needs to have the [API PCI Payments role](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/api-credentials#roles).
- PHP 7.3 or later
- cURL with SSL support.
- The JSON PHP extension.
- See [composer require list](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-php-api-library/blob/develop/composer.json#L10) for the complete list of dependencies

### Legacy version support

If using PHP versions 7.2 or lower, download our library version [6.3.0](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-php-api-library/releases/tag/6.3.0).

## Installation

You can use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/). Follow the [installation instructions](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) if you do not already have composer installed.

~~~~ bash
composer require adyen/php-api-library
~~~~

In your PHP script, make sure you include the autoloader:

~~~~ php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
~~~~

Alternatively, you can download the [release on GitHub](https://github.com/Adyen/adyen-php-api-library/releases).

## Using the library

### General use with API key

Set up the client as a singleton resource; you'll use it for the API calls that you make to Adyen:

~~~~ php
$client = new \Adyen\Client();

$client->setXApiKey("YOUR API KEY");
$client->setEnvironment(\Adyen\Environment::TEST);
$client->setTimeout(30);

$service = new \Adyen\Service\Checkout($client);

$json = '{
      "card": {
        "encryptedCardNumber": "test_4111111111111111",
        "encryptedExpiryMonth": "test_03",
        "encryptedExpiryYear": "test_2030",
        "encryptedSecurityCode": "test_737",
        "holderName": "John Smith"
      },
      "amount": {
        "value": 1500,
        "currency": "EUR"
      },
      "reference": "payment-test",
      "merchantAccount": "YOUR MERCHANT ACCOUNT"
}';

$params = json_decode($json, true);

$result = $service->payments($params);
~~~~

### General use with API key for live environment
~~~~ php
$client = new \Adyen\Client();
$client->setXApiKey("YOUR API KEY");
$client->setEnvironment(\Adyen\Environment::LIVE, 'Your live URL prefix');
$client->setTimeout(30);
 
...
~~~~

### General use with basic auth
~~~~ php
$client = new \Adyen\Client();
$client->setUsername("YOUR USERNAME");
$client->setPassword("YOUR PASSWORD");
$client->setEnvironment(\Adyen\Environment::TEST);
$client->setTimeout(30);

$service = new \Adyen\Service\Payment($client);

$json = '{
      "card": {
        "number": "4111111111111111",
        "expiryMonth": "10",
        "expiryYear": "2020",
        "cvc": "737",
        "holderName": "John Smith"
      },
      "amount": {
        "value": 1500,
        "currency": "EUR"
      },
      "reference": "payment-test",
      "merchantAccount": "YOUR MERCHANT ACCOUNT"
}';

$params = json_decode($json, true);

$result = $service->authorise($params);
~~~~

### Example integration

For a closer look at how our PHP library works, clone our [Laravel example integration](https://github.com/adyen-examples/adyen-php-online-payments). This includes commented code, highlighting key features and concepts, and examples of API calls that can be made using the library.

### Running the tests
For the test cases you need the PCI permission enabled on you account. There are no test cases for CSE because credit card data is encrypted through our javascript library.
By default the test will then be skipped. If you have these permissions fill in your account details in the config/test.ini file to let the test work.
To make the automatic testing cases work for your account change the credentials in the config/test.ini file.
