## Reporting a Vulnerability

We welcome reports of possible vulnerabilities or issues as part of our responsible disclosure program. At this point in time we do not run a bug bounty program.

If the nature of the security issue is sensitive, please provide the following:

* Describe the issue to help us determine priority.

The security team will communicate directly with you using PGP encrypted emails.
